# tree_generator

Tree generator is a utility tool which generates graph tree for visualisation using HTML and CSS.
Currently, user has to manually implement the graph based on a specific structure. For reference check index.html

** TODO:
This is Stage 1 of the development where we have implemented it using just CSS.
Future implementation is to generate the data from JSON using vanilla JAVASCRIPT.

Info:
- For vertical graph use the css class: main-vertical
